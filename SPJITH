DIFFERNCE BETWEEN THE DOCUMENT AND WINDOWS OBJECT.
A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document object for manipulation inside the document.
The first thing that gets loaded into the browser is the window and the properties related to that window are stored in the window object.
When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser, it becomes a document object.
The document object is the root node of the HTML document. The document object is a property of the window object.

DOCUMENT;
It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.
It is loaded inside the window.
t is the object of window property.
All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.
We can access the document from a window using the window. document
The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)
Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed by a window like this window. document.title
syntax: document.propertyname;
example:document.title :  will return the title of the document.
activeElement	Returns the currently focused element in the document
addEventListener()	Attaches an event handler to the document
adoptNode()	Adopts a node from another document
baseURI	Returns the absolute base URI of a document
body	Sets or returns the document's body (the <body> element)
characterSet	Returns the character encoding for the document

WINDOWS;
It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.   
It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.
It is the object of the browser.
Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.
We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window
The window is part of BOM, not DOM.
Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.
syntax:window.propertyname;
example:window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser
customElements: It returns a reference to the CustomElementRegistry object, which can be used to register new custom elements and also get information about already registered custom elements.
crypto: It returns the browser crypto object.
devicePixelRatio: It returns the ratio between physical pixels and device-independent pixels in the current display.
Document: It returns a reference to the document object of that window.
DOMMatrix: It returns a reference to a DOMMatrix object, which represents 4Ã—4 matrices, suitable for 2D and 3D operations.
frames[]: It represents an array that contains all the frames of a given window.
DOMPoint: It returns a reference to a DOMPoint object, which represents a 2D or 3D point in a coordinate system.
